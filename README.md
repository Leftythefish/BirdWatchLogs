# BirdieLogger
React app to track/log bird observations. Uses JSON-Server as a mock backend.

## Details

* The project foundation is scaffolded with create-React-app.	
* For development prototyping purposes, the project backend uses a fake REST API: JSON server 
[https://github.com/typicode/json-server], which stores the data in a JSON document. 		
* UI styling is built using Materialize framework [https://materializecss.com/] and some custom CSS.
* Redux and React-Redux [https://redux.js.org/ & https://react-redux.js.org/] are used for state management.

## Setup:

  ### `npm install`
  ### `npm run dev`
  
  The front-end will run on http://localhost:300 and the server on http://localhost:5000.
  Any data saved to the list will be in db.json.
